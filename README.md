# Food-Vision-Model
Detecting food using TensorFlow typically involves using pre-trained models like TensorFlow Object Detection API or training custom models:

Data Preparation: Collect and annotate a dataset of food images with bounding boxes or labels.

Model Selection: Choose a suitable pre-trained model or architecture like Faster R-CNN, SSD, or YOLO, depending on accuracy and speed requirements.

Fine-tuning or Training: Fine-tune the chosen model on your food dataset or train a custom model from scratch if necessary.

Inference: Use the trained model for inference to detect and classify different types of food in new images or videos.

Deployment: Integrate the model into applications or systems to automate food detection tasks, such as dietary assessment or restaurant menu analysis.

Implementing food detection with TensorFlow leverages its powerful APIs and ecosystem, enabling robust and scalable solutions for image recognition tasks in food-related domains.
